# Neural Networks for Binary Classification 

This assignment applies a two-layer neural network to perform binary classification using fully vectorized operations.  
It is part of **Week 1 (Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms)** from the **Machine Learning Specialization** by **Andrew Ng** on Coursera.

##  Description

In this lab, I implemented a simple neural network from scratch to classify points in a 2D space. The model includes forward propagation, loss calculation, backward propagation, and parameter updates — all optimized through **vectorization** to enhance performance.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Two-layer neural network structure
- Binary classification using sigmoid activation
- Vectorized implementation for speed and scalability
- Loss function: Binary cross-entropy
- Gradient computation and backpropagation
- Visualization of predictions and decision boundaries

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Files Included

- `neural_network_lab.ipynb`: Main notebook with the complete neural network implementation
- `lab_utils_common.py`: Helper functions for plotting and data handling
- `data/`: Contains input features and labels used for training

> ⚠️ This repository includes only my own implementation, following Coursera’s Honor Code.
